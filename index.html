        <p1>Greetings and Salutations! My name is unofficially <em>Naya LaRose-Star</em> and I want to make video games for a living. <br> I like geeking out about video games (mostly Nintendo), my favorite animes (and reading fanfiction about them), and struggling with learning how to code (and that keyboard). Spending quality time with my friends and family is a necessary pasttime; however, I can be shy and reserved when meeeting new people and expressing my interests. Once we share the same passion for something, this night owl is your friend for life.</p1>
